   miRNA
      Class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), have an average length of 21â€“23 nucleotides.
      They are endogenous regulatory molecules that modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally 
      by inducing target mRNA silencing and decay. Additional roles beyond negative modulation 
      of mRNA function have also been proposed.
      
   isomiR
      miRNAs can frequently appear in the form of multiple sequence variants or isoforms (termed isomiRs).
   
   Reads
      An inferred sequence of base pairs (or base pair probabilities) corresponding to all or part of a single DNA fragment. 
   
   mirBase
      A searchable database of published miRNA sequences and annotation.
      
   mirTop
      Command line tool to annotate with a standard naming miRNAs e isomiRs.
   
   Pypi
      Python package index (Pypi, https://pypi.org/) is a repository of software for the 
      Python programming language.
   
   reStructuredText (ReST)
      reStructuredText format (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html). An easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get 
      plaintext markup syntax and parser system.
   
   Sphinx
      Python module for documentation. See details in http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
